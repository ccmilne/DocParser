    "content": "We show that the amount of foreign exchange reserves (FER) in the world in a given currency is highly correlated with the GDP and military spending of that country for a set of western economies during the last 20 years. Taking into account multicollinearity, Ridge and Lasso regressions reveal that the Foreign Exchange Reserve is better explained by military spending than GDP for seven western currencies. For each year shown, military spending is statistically significant more than the monetary instrument M2. Comparing the currency of the second world economy, the Chinese renminbi, is well beyond the western FER equilibrium, but yearly analysis shows that there is a steady trend towards a new FER balance. Next, we define a complex geopolitical network model in which the probability of switching to an alternative FER currency depends both on economic and political factors. Military spending is introduced into the model as an average share of GDP observed within the data. As the GDP of a particular country grows, so does the military power of a country. The nature of the creation of new currency networks initially depends only on geopolitical allegiance. As the volume of trade with a particular country changes over a designated threshold, a country switches to the currency of that country due to increased trade. If the current steady trend continues within the same geopolitical setting as in the past twenty years, we extrapolate that the RMB and Western currencies could reach a new FER balance within 15 to 40 years, depending on the model setup.",

    "content": "How do countries decide what basket of currencies to use within their foreign exchange reserves has been a research question that has puzzled scientists in both political science and economics for several decades. However, after decades of research we do not have a definite answer on what the driving factors are of such peripheral choices, but rather mixed evidence based on different economic and political factors. The seminal analysis of Eichengreen, Mehl, and Chi≈£u (2019), conducted in a set of countries before World War I, has provided a dual theoretical framework of economic and security/geopolitical factors that are having an effect on the currency composition of foreign exchange reserves. In this study, scholars employ two main approaches to analyze which currencies should be used in international transactions and as savings in deposits Eichengreen et al. (2019). In the so-called Mercury hypothesis, scholars focus on economic costs and benefits, safety, liquidity, inflation forecasts, as in Romer and Romer (2000), when explaining why some currencies are used more than others in cross-border transactions, e.g. Eichengreen and Flandreau (2008). On the other side of the argument, scholars also hypothesize the so-called Mars hypothesis, which is focused on geopolitical elements such as the role of strategic and military-power have on others when governments choose reserve currencies. Their estimates are based on the hypothesis that military power provides a stabile economic environment and less exchange rate volatility of that particular economy, so there is a great deal of interconnectedness of political and economic factors. In addition, the leading countries can exert successful political and military hegemony based on which they encourage other countries to use their currencies Eichengreen and Sachs (1985). The literature has existent evidence on the economic factors affecting the decision to hold foreign reserves in a particular currency, but it is scarce on evidence of geopolitical factors, such as political influence and military strength, shaping decisions on foreign exchange reserves. The main reason is the lack of causal identification and the complexity of defining geopolitical factors such as political or military power through a single variable or within a model. In this study, we provide a network theory model to show under different parameter values how different political factors, such as the same geo-political allegiance may have even stronger effect on choosing the dominant foreign exchange currency than the economic factors. As Eichengreen et al. (2019) stated, the Mars hypothesis may vividly explain why Japan, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium have a higher percentage of their foreign reserves in dollars in contrast to France, for instance, a country with nuclear weapons. It seems that a stronger military power can diversify its portfolio in its foreign reserves much more than just a common non-nuclear US ally dependent on the United States for security. With the turbulent geopolitical tensions between the US and the EU around NATO involvement, this topic has become more important than ever. Not only for NATO members, but also for the entire world. The Mars hypothesis of geopolitical factors being more important than economic may be further supported by the fact that during the last few years China has been rapidly disposing of the dollars in its foreign reserves, as shown in Figure 1. Similarly, Russia has been reducing the amount of holdings in dollars since starting their initial invasion in Ukraine in 2014. As shown in Figure 2 it has been steadily dropping from year to year. In contrast, even though India created BRICS together with Russia and China, its attitude towards holdings of US Treasury's is completely different, it has been increasing over the past decade (see Figure 3). Looking at only these three geopolitical superpowers in relations to the US we cannot disentangle whether economic factors were the main reason of the change in holdings of US Treasuries or geopolitical factors, such as invasion of Ukraine, change in the US rhetoric towards China, or something else. When politicians in country A start openly saying that country B is a threat and even an enemy, savings and trading are no longer just an economic issue, but rather a broader political issue. In that case a larger weight is put on the long run geopolitical goals, than on short term economic goals. US treasuries may be a much safer investment, but countries will not support strengthening of economic power of their foes, on the contrary, they will do everything in their power to weaken them economically.",

If by chance they met as random walkers, one would tear the other apart, even though they had never met before. Indeed, until a couple of years ago even the largest US opponents, Russia and China, when they trade through the West-controlled SWIFT payment system Eichengreen (2024), the payments were realized mainly in dollars, ultimately helping the U.S. economy and particularly making its currency stronger. In a homogeneous world where there is only a single dominant power, even the largest competitors partially pay the bill. Generally, the more countries save and trade in a country's currency, the stronger the currency, but also weaken the inflation shocks once the country prints new money during recessions, lockdowns, and wars. Therefore, the dominance of the world leader is maintained not only through the country's military power but also through controlled financial and banking systems.",

    "content": "In the first part, we analyze the linear relationship between the currency composition of Official Foreign Exchange Reserves (COFER) collected by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and GDP and MS of some western-most countries, China, and a group of other aggregated countries for a time period ranging from 2003 to 2023. We observe a rather stable regression relationship between (the logarithm of) Foreign Exchange Reserve Composition and both (the logarithm of) GDP and (the logarithm of) MS of western countries. Data on the Chinese renminbi (RMB) and on aggregated other currencies with the corresponding GDP or military spending are outliers with respect to the linear relationship between FER versus GDP and FER versus MS. The yearly analysis performed during the period from 2016 to 2023 (that is, since when the IMF report data for Chinese RMB) shows that the role of Chinese RMB in (a) FER and GDP and (b) FER and MS of China progressively converges to the level of linear relationship typically observed for western countries. To investigate the role of multicollinearity in regression analysis, we apply methods such as Ridge and Lasso as in James, Witten, Hastie, Tibshirani, and Taylor (2013) and verify that MS is more explicative than the GDP level for the seven western countries (Australia, Canada, EU, Japan, Swiss, UK, US). Similarly as in the research so far, we acknowledge all the limitations our study may have towards a more causal interpretation of our estimates. Inspired by the Mars hypothesis, we report that a country's military spending, taken as a proxy for the size of a country, highly correlates with the country's currency in Foreign Exchange Reserves (FER), where the Chinese RMB is well outside the FER equilibrium, but there is a steady trend towards a new FER balance. If this gradual and not abrupt trend continues in the coming years, the RMB may reach the new FER balance within approximately 15 years. In the model, once China's GDP overtakes that of the U.S., the U.S. responds by implementing sanctions and imposing restrictions on its domestic market. In turn, China begins a process of dedollarization, which aligns well with empirical data.",

From the early 1990s to 2018, according to Arslan and Cant√∫ (2019) emerging market economies increased their FX reserves from approximately 5% to nearly 30% of GDP. Historically, the US dollar has been a prominent currency for FER, but in the last decade we have seen significant shifts from that equilibrium.

More specifically, a contrary view Alwadeai, Vlasova, Mareeh, and Aljonaid (2024) investigates the impact of economic sanctions on the volatility of exchange rates, with a specific focus on the role of foreign reserves in mitigating these effects.

The opportunity cost of holding reserves is significant, as these funds could otherwise be invested in domestic projects to stimulate economic growth. Moreover, excessive accumulation of reserves may lead to issues such as inflationary pressures and asset bubbles. Similarly, Levy-Yeyati and G√≥mez (2020) illustrate that the cost of holding reserves may have been considerably lower than is generally assumed in both the academic literature and the policy debate. In order to establish a benchmark, Jeanne and Ranci√®re (2011) provide a framework for determining optimal reserve levels for emerging market economies based on various economic parameters. A benchmark calibration suggests that an optimal level of reserves for EMEs is approximately 10.1% of GDP, or 92% of short-term external debt, which is close to the average ratio observed between 1975 and 2003.",

    "content": "Unlike most economics models which consider only an economic framework to calibrate the model, our theoretical model considers geopolitical shocks as both of economic or purely political nature. For example, Russia's invasion of Ukraine has been a military move that has had an enormous effect on cutting off geopolitical ties. For that reason, in our model we introduce different variables of military strength, which, in addition to economic strength, also have a crucial effect of positioning in the global FER market. The interconnection between FER reserves, GDP, and military spending is complex and multifaceted. Economic strength, as reflected in GDP, provides the foundation for both accumulating FER reserves and sustaining military expenditures.",

    "content": "The first strand of the literature connects different economic measures, mainly GDP, with military spending. Clements, Gupta, and Khamidova (2021) find that military spending in relation to GDP does not reach a common level in 138 countries in their sample. It is divided into three main groups. The first group of 20 countries experiencing a high degree of conflict, spending has increased and diverged from the global trend. The second group has the largest number of countries - 77, of which 30 are advanced economies - generating 90 percent of global military spending. Their average military spending in relation to GDP fell significantly from 1990 through the mid-2000s, but has changed little since then. This group includes China, India, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States. Furthermore, Barnum, Fariss, Markowitz, and Morales (2025) find two interesting findings related to our research. First, correlations between economic surplus and military spending are currently higher than at any point in the last 200 years. Second, find that the (negative) effect of a democratic ally on military spending is three times larger, and the (positive) effect of an increase in GDP is five times larger than previously estimated.",

    "content": "Military expenditure is a critical component of a nation's defense strategy, directly influencing its military capabilities and power projection. The relationship between military spending and economic growth has been extensively studied, yielding mixed findings. Some research suggests that increased defense spending can stimulate economic activity through job creation and technological advancements. However, other studies argue that excessive military expenditure can crowd out public investment in other sectors, potentially hindering economic growth. For example, Peltier (2023) provide an in-depth analysis on how decades of high levels of military spending have changed the US government and society, strengthening its ability to fight wars while weakening its capacities to perform other core functions. They highlight in their study how investments in infrastructure, healthcare, education, and emergency preparedness, for instance, have all suffered as military spending and industry have crowded them out.",

This underscores the importance of aligning military ambitions with economic realities to ensure sustainable national power. Moreover, Modelski and Thompson (1996) argue that naval power is the key tool that allows world political leadership, colonization, and domination in world trade. However, a less explored topic in most studies of hegemonic patterns is the military expenditure factor in the competition between states for military and economic dominance. The leader nation increases its military capabilities to maintain its dominant position, while the alliance states support the leader in order to benefit from greater investments in their economies, as in Modelski and Thompson (1996). Regarding the link between military and economy, Kennedy (1989) pointed out a significant correlation between revenue raising capacities and the military strength of the country. Paul Kennedy also argued that military spending by hegemonic countries can become a burden on its economy, eventually heading to economic collapse. This argument seems to be controversial due to the lack of economic analyses that would support his basic idea of the interaction between military spending and economic growth.",

History has been full of changes in military and economic power, yet how these changes affected changes in foreign exchange reserves is relatively understudied. For many decades during which the United Kingdom had been dominating the entire world, the UK sterling was the leading currency, just to be later changed by the US dollar. For example, Triffin (1960) estimated that not only in 1928, the share of pound sterling of global foreign exchange reserves was around 80 percent, but even in 1938 pound starlings share remained around 70 percent. More recently, Chinn and Frankel (2008), suggested that dollars only overtook sterling after World War II. Based on data gained from central bank archives, Eichengreen and Sachs (1985) and Eichengreen and Sachs (1986), reported that the dollar overtook sterling as the leading global reserve currency in the mid-1920s, not in 1928, 1938 or 1948.",

Applying data on foreign currency reserves of 19 countries before World War I, for which the currency composition of reserves and military and security alliance memberships are known, Eichengreen et al. (2019) validated the hypotheses of Mercury and Mars. They demonstrated that military alliances increase the currency percentage in the ally's foreign reserve assets by 30 percentage points. Eichengreen et al. (2019) argued about why a country decides to use an ally's currency by linking the national security and military alliance on one side and foreign policy planning of foreign currency reserves on the other. Reserve currency issuers such as the US may use military-dependent nations to obtain finance from them by issuing treasuries or, as in the case of the US, the nuclear power as the financial center may borrow funds to their allies.",

    "content": "Beyond solely geopolitical alliances, there are other factors to keep an ally s currency. In articles on foreign reserve currency, financial depth and development is an important factor Portes and Rey (1998). Moreover, Chitu, Eichengreen, and Mehl (2014) demonstrate that financial development was the most important factor in helping the dollar overcome sterling's dominance as an international financing currency during the interwar period. The credibility of the reserve currency issuers is motivated by theoretical models in which agents in non-dollar economies trade indirectly using the US dollar instead of using direct bilateral trade among their own currencies if these currencies depreciate too often and for too long and there are substantial transaction costs of exchange according to Devereux and Shi (2013). Economic size is another standard factor of international currency choice. Krugman (1980) discussed the effects of the network, focusing on the increased returns resulting from economies of scale. The economy of scale was a topic in the random matching model of Matsuyama, Kiyotaki, and Matsui (1993), who model the choice of international currencies in a way that the incentive of an agent to accept a country's currency depends on the frequency of trades with a given country. Furthermore, the strategic use of FER reserves can influence a nation's defense posture. For example, countries with substantial reserves may have greater flexibility in responding to economic sanctions or funding defense initiatives without resorting to external borrowing. However, the opportunity cost of holding large reserves, as opposed to investing in economic development, must be carefully considered. Thus, policymakers must navigate the delicate balance between maintaining sufficient FER reserves, fostering economic growth, and allocating resources to defense to ensure comprehensive national security.",

Surprisingly high R may support the Mars hypothesis, suggesting that western FER currencies have already reached an FER equilibrium between the average MS and the fraction of FER. Note that all currencies in our analysis belong to US allies and, therefore, the set represents a proxy for a variable alliance, as suggested by Eichengreen, Mehl, and ChituEichengreen et al. (2019).

Indeed, the fractions of pounds, yen, euro, and both Australian and Canadian dollars in Foreign Exchange Reserves are just a bit larger than are the fraction of country's GDP in the world's GDP. Only in the case of the dollar, that currency is substantially more represented in the Reserves than is the US fraction in the World GDP. In contrast, the Chinese RMB is far from the balance, but with a steady increase towards the potential future balance. Next, we report that not only Military Spending, but also GDP (see Table 1) is in strong correlation with foreign exchange reserves. Comparing R in Table 1 and Table 2 we report that MS is also more influential than the overall country fraction of international trade. Recalling that the variables are standardized, Table 3 reports that MS is more influential than GDP for each year considered.",

The prediction assumes that in years to come the world will experience gradual changes in relationship between the U.S. and China, and not the breakdown-in-relations scenario in which the world financial system is heading to a tipping point. In contrast to the RMB dummy coefficient, the dummy coefficient corresponding to Others exhibits stability to a great extent in the same years. It is important to note that this is based on linear trend and is a simplification because year-to-year ceteris paribus conditions of other variables will have a differential effect on the trend.",

The estimated highly statistically significant coefficient on military spending is in line with the Mars hypothesis. Among controlling variables, gold reserves significantly negatively depend on FER for some years, where it is not surprising that the coefficient is negative, since gold and money are competitors, which is vividly shown for Russia and China which dollars have been replacing with gold. Note that in contrast to China and Russia, developed western countries have decreased gold reserves during the last two decades. Table 4 shows that international trade is generally not a significant variable. Table 4 shows that FER significantly depends on the monetary instrument M2 for most of the years chosen (shown in Figs. 6 and 7). However, for each year shown, MS is more statistically significant than M2. Comparing Tables 3 and 4, we note that over time the inclusion of controlling variables reduces the coefficient Œ≤ much faster than without controlling variables. Table 5 shows that standard errors are robust to heteroskedasticity.",

As a country grows economically, especially through international trade, more and more countries are using its currency. As China's GDP approaches the US GDP, especially measured in the PPP, the probability of geopolitical motives such as trade wars and tariffs starts to increase because the country that introduced globalization will not allow another country to overtake its primacy as a world economic leader. Namely, a country that would achieve the same GDP and then even larger GDP than the U.S:, especially in PPP terms, would be in position to invest more money than the U.S. in the military, research and science, and as time passes, then that country would naturally become a new world leader. As we stated in the introductory part of the paper, there is a reason why there is no place on Earth where tigers and lions live together because they are predators of the same level.",

However, as a countermeasure, the competing country also uses geopolitical tools and even initiates geopolitical tools in an economic war. If a particular country is a competitor, it will not help the economy of different geopolitical blocs by saving in their currency and using it in trades with other countries. The introduction of tariffs and sanctions is an example of different geopolitical tools to increase country's geopolitical position.",

    "content": "We model the global monetary system as an undirected network G = (V, E) consisting of N = 195 sovereign states, represented as nodes. Each edge (i, j) ‚àà E denotes economic interactions: trade flows, financial interdependencies, or strategic partnerships. Node 0 is assigned to the United States (USD) while nodes 1 and 2 represent a set of geopolitical rivals, China and Russia, explicitly assigned their own currencies (CNY, RUB) and economic growth characteristics. The remaining nodes (3‚Äì194) represent independent states, initially dollarized but subject to network contagion-driven dedollarization. Each country i maintains three dynamic state variables: a GDP time series GDP (m), a dedollarization level d (m) ‚àà [0,1], and a primary currency label c (m) ‚àà {USD, CNY, RUB}. We initialize GDP trajectories using historical annual data (2010 to the latest available year) for the United States, China, and Russia, which we interpolate to a monthly frequency. Beyond empirical observations, each core series is extrapolated using fixed annual growth rates: 2% for the U.S., 3% for China, and 1% for Russia, converted to equivalent monthly growth factors. For peripheral states, we draw the initial GDPs from a Pareto distribution with shape parameter Œ± = 2.5 and scale x = 0.5 √ó 10 , a choice motivated by the heavy-tailed heterogeneous size distribution observed in real-world country GDPs, and then apply a uniform annual growth rate 2% (also converted to a monthly factor). The network employs a hub-and-spoke topology with the U.S. (node 0) at its center. Each non-U.S. node connects directly to the U.S. Additional peer-to-peer edges are introduced among non-U.S. countries to achieve a minimum degree of ten, with probabilities proportional to their GDP. Thus, larger economies exhibit greater centrality. We have found that GDP and military spending correlate with a surprisingly high R , suggesting that GDP serves as an excellent proxy for military spending. In other words, based on the analysis of Clements et al. (2021), there is a general convergence to a steady state of military spending as a share of GDP between countries. Therefore, implicitly in our analysis, GDP growth also represents a proportionally growth of military spending. Based on this finding, we assume in the model that GDP and military spending are linearly dependent, such that MS = Œ≥ ¬∑ GDP. Thus, in our model, GDP effectively serves as a proxy for military spending.",

During the period of globalization, the world FER market was in a state of equilibrium or at least quasi-equilibrium, where only the currencies of developed Western democracies were being used for the savings of all countries. However, in the model, we hypothesize that as China approaches the US in terms of GDP, the probability that the U.S. will respond with geopolitical moves such as sanctions, reduction of imports from China, ban of chip exports, and tariffs ramps up, where as a response China automatically responds with de-dollarization. In agreement with this hypothesis, Fig. 8 shows how USA imports from China grew continuously for years until China reached the American GDP in terms of purchasing power. We further hypothesize that if the public debt interest of the global leader exceeds its military spending, it leads to a declining confidence in the global leader currency in agreement with Ferguson's law which states that any great power that spends more on debt than on military spending risks ceasing to be a great power.",

The Chinese RMB is currently well beyond the FER balance, but there is a steady trend towards a new FER balance. By assuming geopolitical relationships similar to those that have been present in the last 20 years, our analysis indicates a trend such that RMB could reach a new FER balance within 15 years. However, our prediction is just an extrapolation of past behavior, and we are perfectly aware that predictions on the FER currency composition have been shown to be wrong Chinn and Frankel (2008). In our network model changes to a different FER currency are mechanically connected to international trade. As certain country's share of international trade grows at an above average rate, its closest neighbors will trade more in its currency, so the growth of dedollarization in our model is implicitly related to the growth of international trade. Empirically, that was a significant feature of China's growth over the past few decades.",

In response, China accelerates dedollarization efforts, a dynamic consistent with the patterns observed in recent empirical data.
