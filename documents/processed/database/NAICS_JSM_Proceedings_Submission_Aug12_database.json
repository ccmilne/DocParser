    "content": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant gains in performance over classical approaches in Information Retrieval (IR) systems. Semantic search, a concept involving a contextual understanding of a query, significantly outperforms its keyword predecessors in recent academic literature. This paper examines five research questions critical to an effective multi-stage retrieval pipeline: [1] how much better can dense embeddings perform over sparse embeddings? [2] what combination of context windows in an ensemble approach can maximize first-candidate generation? [3] among top performers in ensemble approaches, which approach can generate the highest accuracy scores when we increase k? [4] can a fast-reranking algorithm complement first-candidate generation to further boost accuracy? [5] can a cache of seen-before queries help boost performance where the corpus fails? This project designs a novel search engine for the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) using semantic retrieval models and achieves an accuracy of 86.87% on synthetic data, a 45.1% improvement over a keyword search. The strategies for bootstrapping data, selecting language models, and using open-source technologies within this project can serve as reference material for future LLM applications in the U.S. Census Bureau.",

NAICS was developed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in 1997 to replace the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) system with innovative classification methodologies for the purpose of supporting interoperability of economic classification between the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. Since 1997, NAICS has evolved through five-year review cycles to 1,012 unique codes within 20 sectors that group establishments by similarity in processes used to produce goods or services. Examples range from Soybean Farming (111110) comprising establishments primarily engaged in growing or producing soybeans to Used Merchandise Retailers (459510) which includes establishments retailing used merchandise, antiques, and secondhand goods. Common definitions for industries and economic sectors such as these have helped the U.S., Canada, and Mexico to understand economic inputs and outputs, industrial performance, productivity, unit labor costs, and employment growth in North America.",

However, string-matching itself constrains user experience by failing to provide relevant documents when queries are lengthy or complex.

Semantic search, where “semantic” meaning is given consideration through the underlying language model's self-attention mechanism, is more effective at handling ambiguity and delivering targeted results. Relatedly, the increasing availability of powerful language models on platforms like Hugging Face, inexpensive vector databases to replace NoSQL databases with faster indexing and querying, and evolving research around retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have made development of customized search engines easier. These advancements present an opportunity for enhancing the retrieval tools available for analysts.",

Dual-encoder neural architectures using pre-trained transformers have shown strong performance on various open-domain question answering tasks (Guo, et al. 2020, Karpukhin, et al. 2020, Liang, et al. 2020, Ma, et al. 2020) and have become a promising framework for advanced IR systems. More recently, the dense approach was extended by hybrid lexical-dense approaches aiming to combine the strengths of both approaches and overcome any weaknesses in distance-based retrieval (Luan, et al. 2021, Raffel, et al. 2020, Gao, et al. 2021).",

The cache is a sample of 679 annotated emails representing “real” queries supplied by Census analysts. The original sample contained 1,910 emails and had been stripped of any personally identifiable information. Pruning unrelated emails (general inquiries, emails lacking business descriptions, non-English, 2017 NAICS codes, etc.) left 1,291 emails, which were then denoised with Zephyr-7b-Beta (Tunstall, et al. 2023), a seq2seq model available on Hugging Face using a prompt that extracts the sentence or two where a business description is mentioned. Removing unnecessary language was crucial for improving signal in prediction and altering queries towards those expected by a search engine. From there, we performed our own annotations and removed any descriptions that evaded previous filters for relevant queries or consisted of typos and incomplete thoughts. The resulting cache consisted of 679 unique queries representing 25.59% of all unique 2022 NAICS codes. Table 2 displays the most frequently seen NAICS codes.",

ColBERT, unlike RRF which requires weight tuning for performance, acts as an independent algorithm with an affinity for keywords that can complement first-stage candidate generation. Hardcoded thresholds based on normalized distributions of correct answers were considered for relevance scores when combining and reranking, but decided against given these values could change if the underlying embeddings model is replaced. Additionally, varying context sizes can produce unpredictable spreads in relevance values making comparison difficult.",

This was performed for a total of 2,323 unique inquiries representing 48.32% of all NAICS codes. Table 3 displays the most frequently seen codes in the synthetic dataset. During data generation, we noticed many descriptions that could also apply to other codes when described ambiguously. While our prompt remained generally relaxed to source diverse language and descriptions, it is possible some query-code pairs are less than optimal.

Test 2 explores RQ2 and reports accuracy at and for all combinations of context windows. From these tests, we generate hypotheses about which combinations are useful, narrowing down to two for future experiments. Test 3 supports RQ3 by analyzing which approach generates reasonable increases in accuracy when given additional k documents, providing the best field of first-generation candidates for reranking. Within this analysis we use the two ensemble approaches selected from the previous test and apply two pruning approaches: Lazy and Greedy. Lazy lets each context window in the ensemble produce the top five documents regardless of whether a previous context window also generated a document with an identical code. The final k documents are sorted by document relevance score. Greedy forces each context window to produce only unique codes, replacing documents already collected only when the relevancy score for a document is higher. Test 4 addresses RQ4 by applying ColBERT as a reranker when given initial k documents ranging from 6-10. We use three unique reranking context windows to identify the best approach. We also keep a close eye on inference speed. Test 5 answers RQ5 by taking the wrong predictions from the best performer across previous experiments and using the cache alone to predict NAICS codes.",

Notably, this pattern does not apply to the BM25 results where T scores just 0.99%, nearly 80% lower than semantic search. Shorter documents constrain word overlap-based retrieval strategies, particularly when language is attribute-centric.",

Additionally, we note the remarkably low inference speed for each context window in dense retrieval.

    "content": "This paper introduces an alternative design for a NAICS search engine with semantic retrieval models achieving a final accuracy of 86.87% on synthetic test data. Our research delivers critical findings on building an effective multi-stage retrieval pipeline. Dense retrieval models provide a stronger selection of first-stage candidates over sparse retrieval models by relying on contextual similarity to overcome vocabulary mismatches. Additionally, combining multiple context windows expanded non-parametric memory with limited increases in inference speed, and multiple context windows associated with each code generated higher accuracy scores in early positions k. We observed a fast complementary reranker such as ColBERT was insufficient in boosting performance after dense retrieval, suggesting additional strategies on reranking are needed for state-of-the-art retrieval pipelines. Lastly, we proved seen-before queries can address edge cases and provide a path forward for improvement when the corpus fails. These findings offer an improved NAICS search experience and open new research directions for similar information retrieval tasks.",

    "content": "The findings from this study should also encourage new research opportunities on the use of LLMs for other critical services across the Bureau. The phases of experimentation in building the search engine—comparing context retrieval windows independently and within ensemble approaches, exploring embeddings models and their influence on downstream performance, reranking strategies, latency limitations, using generative models to clean or alter messy data—bear relevance on other applications beyond search. Summarization, classification, named entity recognition, and translation are among the tasks involved in the building of this project and are frequently used in services across the Bureau. Moreover, deploying LLMs and updating critical government services is a key mandate within the Federal government, motivated in part by a recent Executive Order encouraging the exploration of AI technologies. By adopting new technologies such as a semantic retrieval-based NAICS search engine, the U.S. Census Bureau can continue standard of excellence and technical prowess within the Federal government.",
