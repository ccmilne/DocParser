    "content": "This paper introduces a novel visual mapping methodology for assessing strategic alignment in national artificial intelligence policies. The proliferation of AI strategies across countries has created an urgent need for analytical frameworks that can evaluate policy coherence between strategic objectives, foresight methods, and implementation instruments. Drawing on data from the OECD AI Policy Observatory, we analyze 15-20 national AI strategies using a combination of matrix-based visualization and network analysis to identify patterns of alignment and misalignment. Our findings reveal distinct alignment archetypes across governance models, with notable variations in how countries integrate foresight methodologies with implementation planning. High-coherence strategies demonstrate strong interconnections between economic competitiveness objectives and robust innovation funding instruments, while common vulnerabilities include misalignment between ethical AI objectives and corresponding regulatory frameworks. The proposed visual mapping approach offers both methodological contributions to policy analysis and practical insights for enhancing strategic coherence in AI governance. This research addresses significant gaps in policy evaluation methodology and provides actionable guidance for policymakers seeking to strengthen alignment in technological governance frameworks.",

Instead, distinct patterns emerge that correlate strongly with governance traditions, institutional arrangements, and policy development approaches. The identification of high-coherence exemplars—particularly Finland, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Germany-demonstrates that exceptional alignment is achievable through deliberate institutional design and systematic coordination mechanisms. These cases share critical features including dedicated cross-governmental coordination bodies, explicit integration of foresight insights with implementation planning, and robust adaptation mechanisms that maintain coherence over time.",
