    "content": "Current AI advances largely rely on scaling neural models and expanding training datasets to achieve generalization and robustness. Despite notable successes, this paradigm incurs significant environmental, economic, and ethical costs, limiting sustainability and equitable access. Inspired by biological sensory systems, where adaptation occurs dynamically at the input (e.g., adjusting pupil size, refocusing vision)—we advocate for adaptive sensing as a necessary and foundational shift. Adaptive sensing proactively modulates sensor parameters (e.g., exposure, sensitiv- ity, multimodal configurations) at the input level, significantly mitigating covariate shifts and improving efficiency. Empirical evidence from recent studies demon- strates that adaptive sensing enables small models (e.g., EfficientNet-B0) to surpass substantially larger models (e.g., OpenCLIP-H) trained with significantly more data and compute. We (i) outline a roadmap for broadly integrating adaptive sensing into real-world applications spanning humanoid, healthcare, autonomous systems, agriculture, and environmental monitoring, (ii) critically assess technical and ethi- cal integration challenges, and (iii) propose targeted research directions, such as standardized benchmarks, real-time adaptive algorithms, multimodal integration, and privacy-preserving methods. Collectively, these efforts aim to transition the AI community toward sustainable, robust, and equitable artificial intelligence systems.",

    "content": "Early neural-network research drew inspiration from cortical neurons, implicitly framing intelligence as a predominantly brain-centered phenomenon [44, 58]. Correspondingly, recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have predominantly relied on scaling model size and expanding training datasets [69, 2, 73, 8]. Although effective, this model-centric paradigm introduces significant and unsustainable challenges, such as massive computational demands that exacerbate environmental degradation [12, 53], socioeconomic inequities due to resource concentration in a few well-funded institutions [10, 11], and persistent failures in generalizing under real-world domain shifts [25, 35].",

    "content": "In contrast, biological cognition is fundamentally embodied: the brain operates within an integrated system comprising sensory organs (e.g., vision, hearing, and touch) and musculature, which forms critical perception-action loops essential for survival and evolutionary success. For robust perception, human sensory systems dynamically adapt at the sensor level both before and during cortical pro- cessing. For instance, humans correct optical blur by wearing corrective lenses rather than retraining their neural circuits with thousands of out-of-focus images. Similarly, when facing low contrast or glare, humans instinctively squint, rapidly narrowing the pupil to sharpen depth-of-field and suppress stray light. Thus, intelligence emerges from the coordinated evolution and dynamic interplay between sensory organs, neural pathways, and adaptive behaviors, not solely from neural complexity alone [33, 65]. This biological principle highlights that effective perception and generalization in AI depend not only on neural capacity but also on dynamic, real-time sensor adaptation throughout the entire perception pipeline.",

    "content": "However, current AI methodologies still primarily address distribution shift by scaling neural ar- chitectures and datasets [49, 15, 2, 57], leaving the sensing interface unchanged. A few existing sensor-aware strategies, such as active perception, which repositions sensors or robots to optimize viewpoints [9, 64], and sensor-fusion budgeting, which schedules when and what modalities to activate [70], operate at the system or motion-planning level. They neglect how raw analog signals are digitized in the first place to best serve the downstream model. Only recently have benchmarks begun isolating the impact of intrinsic sensor settings, such as exposure and gain, on recognition accuracy [7, 6]. Inspired by these insights, the concept of test-time input adaptation has emerged: dynamically optimizing sensor parameters frame-by-frame to deliver model-friendly data. A first prototype, Lens [6], significantly outperforms traditional (human-oriented) auto-exposure methods, maintaining high classification accuracy despite a 50× reduction in model size. Preliminary evi- dence suggests even greater potential: with ideal sensor adaptation, a lightweight 5M-parameter EfficientNet-B0 [42] can surpass the 632M-parameter OpenCLIP-H [29] trained on 160× more training data [7]. These early results highlight both the promise of adaptive sensing and the urgency of systematic exploration.",

By shaping incoming photons, acoustic waves, or tactile forces at the sensor, it boosts efficiency and robustness in fields such as medical diagnostics [54, 4], autonomous driving [60], surveillance [77], and environmental monitoring [3, 43]. This capability is becoming critical as AI increasingly transitions from artificial, controlled simulations to physical, embodied deployments [51]. In real-world robots and wearable devices, identical models may receive data from lenses, CCDs, MEMS microphones, or tactile skins, each differing across vendor, firmware, and production batch. These subtle differences introduce domain shifts, either explicit or latent, that are difficult to address through model advancement alone.",

Physical AI platforms from micro-drones to neural prostheses face inherent limits in size, energy, and thermal dissipation, suggesting limits to the traditional “bigger model, bigger dataset\" paradigm. Adaptive sensing provides a complementary solution: by reshaping inputs directly at the source, it delivers model-friendly signals that enable smaller networks to thrive. Just as the human visual system couples rapid eye movements to visual cognition, next-generation AI systems must integrate closed-loop, real-time sensor control and preprocessing directly into their inference pipeline.",

While biological sensors embed rapid, energy-proportional adaptation in hardware, modulating gain, bandwidth, and spatial resolution before neural inference begins, modern artificial sensors, such as cameras, microphones, and haptic arrays, remain predominantly static (Table 1). Bridging this gap through adaptive sensing at the input level would enable smaller, faster, and fairer AI models, providing a compelling path toward sustainable and equitable artificial intelligence.",

    "content": "This section explores the deeper potential of adaptive sensing within embodied AI, expanding beyond the initial evaluation in static image classification tasks. Current embodied AI systems predominantly rely on action-centric training without explicitly considering adaptive sensing, resulting in inefficient learning and limited adaptability [18]. This limitation becomes particularly evident when comparing action-only embodied agents to humans, who seamlessly integrate sensory adaptation with motor actions in a closed-loop manner. For instance, consider a balancing task (Fig. 2a), which involves simultaneous covariate shifts [5, 80, 7] stemming from variations in environmental conditions, sensor interfaces and parameters, and agent morphologies (Fig. 2c), and extremely sparse reward signals relative to the complexity of the multi-sensor, multi-modal exploration space (Fig. 2b). Humans quickly achieve robust performance through efficient closed-loop sensory feedback, requiring only a few training trials and effortlessly adapting to new conditions. In contrast, embodied agents relying solely on motor actions significantly lag in both learning speed and real-world robustness.",

These approaches fail to consider the crucial role of ongoing closed-loop feedback between sensing, perception, and action, which is essential for embodied agents operating within dynamic, real-world conditions. Moreover, current methods do not actively utilize model perception feedback to guide sensor parameter exploration. This limitation is especially critical in continuous, sparse-reward scenarios, where effective navigation of the sensor configuration space through closed-loop adaptive sensing is critical for robust and efficient learning. Addressing these gaps is imperative for successfully integrating adaptive sensing with continuous, action-driven learning paradigms in embodied AI.",

For example, when standing still, weight shifts toward the forefoot increase reliance on toe pressure sensors, whereas a lateral push engages ankle proprioceptors more heavily to restore balance. Formally, at each timestep t, we introduce a modality-weight vector w ∈ R across N available sensory modalities (e.g., pressure, torque, IMU), typically normalized so that Σ w [n] = 1. Extending the single-modality sensing policy π and measurement function f, we define the multi-modality sensing policy π and measurement function f as:",

Drawing inspiration from robust biological sensory systems, adaptive sensing provides a practical pathway toward environmentally sustainable, computationally efficient, ethically responsible, and equitably distributed AI capabilities. By actively optimizing sensor parameters at the input stage, adaptive sensing significantly alleviates the computational and economic burdens currently in large-scale model training and deployment.",
